m) How can we achieve this (2 methods) ? Write the steps to these 2 methods in a text file.

method1:
	1) open directory that have bash script "part1.sh"
	  "cd /path/"
	2) move script to /usr/local/bin/
	  sudo mv part1.sh /usr/local/bin/
	3) give permisstion to execute the script
	  sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/part1.sh
	4) it can now run from anywhere by using just the name
	
method2:
	1) find directory where script is exist 
	  pwd part1.sh
	2) add path as local variable to shell by export
	   export PATH=$PATH:/home/irene/project linux/project/part1
	3) now we can run it but it isn't permenant change (life time of terminal)
	 

n) We would like this change to be permanent, how can we do this?
	1) open .bashrc file
	  nano ~/.bashrc
	2) add following line 
	  export PATH=$PATH:/home/irene/project linux/project/part1
	3) save it and close

o) We just made this change permanent, but we don’t want to wait until another terminal is
opened, we would like to make this change NOW, and in this terminal. What could we do?
	run command to make chages immediatly
	  source ~/.bashrc
